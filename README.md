## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 3

_exceptions, inner classes, k-means clustering_

* * *

### Goals

1. Extend the design of the Cluster, and implement a new class, KMeans, which performs K-means clustering on multidimensional real-valued data.
2. Learn implement and use exceptions to fortify your program's interface.
3. Practice input/output within the streams abstraction.
4. Complete the design and implementation of a fully functional C++ program.
